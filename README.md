# Torchio: demonstration editions

The editions pressed with [Torchio](https://github.com/emmcarbe/torchio),
kept apart from the engine so that materials with limited rights can be
added and removed without touching it.

Demonstration editions generated with Torchio from the sources in
`sources/`. To regenerate, for example:
`node tools/press.js --site demo-src/odissea/odissea.xml docs/odissea`
and `node tools/press.js --site demo-src/vangogh docs/vangogh`.
